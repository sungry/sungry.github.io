      Stereotypes. How many times do we let ourselves laugh and make jokes about other people's stereotypes?
      As an Asian male living in the states, the dynamics between races to me always has been an interesting topic to me. Luckily, no harm has been done to me, but I have to admit I've been both a do-er and a victim.

      More than stereotypes, I am interested in subtle racial discrimination that is happening in the world now.
