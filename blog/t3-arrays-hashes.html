     <h1>ARRAYS</h1>
        In short, arrays are ordered, integer-indexed collections of any object.
      For example, one can say an array is like the daily pill organizer. It's a long container and there are many little containers in the containers.
      The difference between this container and array is that where your container might have 7 little boxes, but an array 'could' have an infinite number of little boxes within it as far as the memory allows.
      Once an array is created, the first one on the left is considered the first element   (index), and instead of 1, the first element is considered placed in the index 0.
      Basically, in an array of 5 indices, the first index is 0 instead of 1. So, 0,1,2,3,4 will be the index number.
      One great thing about arrays is that we can easily access whichever element by simply pointing out the exact index number! Just like if your mom asked where the Thursday pills are, you can tell her "Mom, I told you it's in the 4th (but index of 3) box about 10,000 times!!", and she will go get it. Easy, right?
      That's pretty much all there is to arrays, but what you CAN do with them is pretty up to your imagination!

        <h1>HASHES</h1>
          In short, a Hash is a dictionary-like collection of unique keys and their values.
          So, what are keys and values?
          Keys and values have a two-part relationship, more like a parent-child relationship. Each key has a relation to a value and vice versa. If a key were a parent, there's a kid that is related to the key. One can access the value of each key by calling the key.
          Let's say the name of this hash is restaurant_menu_price and they sell 'Ramen (key)' for the price of 11.00 dollars(value).
          You would type:
           restaurant_men_price["Ramen"]
          then the complier will bring out the price (11.00).
          It's not bad right? This is a very simple example, but the type of value a key can hold varies! You can imagine how useful when you want to store or retrieve data with Hashes!
