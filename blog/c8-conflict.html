  <h1> Conflicts </h1>
      <p>
  As we live and work with others, we are more than likely to have conflicts with them. We all come from different backgrounds, and sometimes, certain conflicts are inevitable.

  Discuss a time you had a conflict. What was it about? What happened?
    One of my roommates had a tendency (still does, but much improved) to disrespct the fact that there are other people living in the same house. He will leave dishes unwashed in the sink, use things then won't put them away... the list went on and on. The rest of us always felt disrespected and irritated but felt uncomfortable to bring it up because he wasn't doint it on purpose. 

What was the source of the conflict?
    It was simply that he wasn't aware of what troubles he was causing. The little things he did/or didn't cause quite a bit of inconvenience to the rest of us. The fact that he wasn't aware made us irritated more.
What basic emotions did you feel upon analyzing the conflict?
    I was the one who got irritated the most. It started with a little bit of annoyance, then grew bigger and bigger as time went on. I really try my best to avoid conflicts and be considerate to others, and I have lower tolerance on what was happening.
What actions did you take to resolve your conflict?
    We were trying to be nice about how we brought it up. We talked to him in the nicest and most civil way a few times - but didn't really fix anything. One time I was very angry when I saw all the food and dishes piled up left, I knew I couldn't be the nice guy anymore..
If you could go back, what would you do differently, if anything?
    Yes, I would've tried to be less angry. Luckily he took it all well, but I did apologize to him for how I was when I talked to him.
What did you learn from this experience?
    Conflicts do happen.. and one should make sure to say things out of respect.
