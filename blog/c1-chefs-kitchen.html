  <h1>ABSTRACT RANDOM LERNER?</h1>
  <h2>I Am Ready To tackle </h2>
  <h4>Today's Date</h4>

    Hello, my fellow abstract and not-abstract denizens of the internet.

    This is my first non-exclusively-music-related blog. I can't not talk about music because it's just a huge part of my life.

    I recently have started a programming bootcamp in SF called Dev Bootcamp which I am really excited and curious about. Anyways, they required that we take a test to see which learning style each of us fits into.
    My result was:
    Abstract Random Learner
    Also I am an hopeless INFJ.

    When I saw the result, I first went "HOLY S#IT, AM I GONNA MAKE IT AS AN ENGINEER?". Because, I thought, good engineers were all born to be VERY NATURALLY logically thinking people. Well, after some desparate research, I found a helpful (and conforting) article about how I could take the advantage of my awesome(!) learning style.

    Here's what I found on
    (http://facstaff.gpc.edu/~jgutliph/Books/learning_styles/Abstract_Random.html):

    Abstract random learners work best when they

    - can work and share with others.
    "My ideas grow better with a friend." TRUE!

    - have assignments requiring personalization.
    "I like to find what things mean to me." TRUE!!!!!!

    - get personal attention and emotional support.
    "I get so angry when a teacher thinks I'm goofing off and I'm not."
    Haven't thought much about this, but this might be helpful?

    - have social activities to balance work.
    "I'll work harder to finish so I can do other things."
    YES, balance is a very important key in my life.

    - can answer, "How can we interpret this?"
    TRUE!! I also love anologies, and I am good at comming up with them!

    - have freedom from control by others.
    "The worst, the very worst, is a teacher who wants everything done his way."
    SOMEWHAT TRUE! but I am also a very good rule-abider.

    - have a personally satisfying environment.
    "I loved the color, posters, artwork, and plans in our French class."
    ABSOLUTELY!

    use personal, individual, or artistic expression.
    "One of my favorite assignments was doing a collage to show the meaning of a song."
    I'm a classically trained musician, after all:)

    have open communication with others.
    "Class meetings are great. You can air your feelings and give your own opinion."
    TRUE!!!

    have a noncompetitive atmosphere.
    "Why does everything have to be done for a grade?"
    ABSOLUTELY AGREE!


    NOW I THINK, I will do pretty well in this bootcamp as long as I make my surroundings open to communication and non-competitive!

    That being said, I was really moved by the video of the found of DBC.
    From what I could hear, although everyone starts from a different beginning, nobody is judged. There are no set rules and anyone can be benefitted from the experience.

    Upon starting the onsite session, I will try to explore my learning style even more deeply. I will be open-minded and warm to others.
    I am truly excited!
