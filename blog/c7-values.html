1.Exploring your values
When you think of the times in your life where youâ€™ve been the
happiest, the proudest, or the most satisfied, which of the following
values come to mind?

  Accomplishments always made me a happy camper. Since I was 7, I played the cello and music accomplishments was always rooted as something that I strived for.
  Accomplishments can be easily measured by others, but the feeling of accomplishment that I had when I gave a great recital was nothing I had felt before.
Whatever I do, I strive to give all I because I know what it is like to feel that something that I worked very hard for fruits in something meaningful.

2.As much as I love feeling accomplished, I don't always find myself trying my best.
