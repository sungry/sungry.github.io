1.Exploring your values
When you think of the times in your life where you’ve been the
happiest, the proudest, or the most satisfied, which of the following
values come to mind?

  Accomplishments always made me a happy camper. Since I was 7, I played the cello and music accomplishments was always rooted as something that I strived for.
  Accomplishments can be easily measured by others, but the feeling of accomplishment that I had when I gave a great recital was nothing I had felt before.
Whatever I do, I strive to give all I because I know what it is like to feel that something that I worked very hard for fruits in something meaningful.

2.As much as I love feeling accomplishemd, I don't always find myself trying my best.
