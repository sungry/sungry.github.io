  <h1>Don't Talk S#H! About Me! Please? </h1>
      <p>Now I have your attention, I can talk about the topic of today. (Kidding!) However, it's not completely irrelevant since I'd like to talk about paring and giving and receiving feedback.

      Paring:
      none
        an arrangement or match resulting from organizing or forming people or things into pairs.

        And pairing program is pretty hot. It's what a lot of companies have implemented in their work space and proven to be very effective.

      Dev Bootcamp, a programming boot camp which I am in, makes pair programming. I've had about 6 pair sessions with other cohorts so far, and I can say they are awesome.
      Here's a list of what I love about pairing programming.

      1. You Learn A Lot About Yourself
      - When you code by yourself, it's very difficult to realize our tendencies. But when you're pairing with another person, it's easy to be pointed at where one thrives or struggles and learn the better way to deal when struggling.

      2. You Learn A LOT About Other People's Style
      - It goes with the first example. But it's very interesting to see how another person approaches the problems and deals with problems when it raises challenges. This is not for you to feel good about yourself (although it just might), but you can always find the best way to advise or help the person if you have a way to solve the problem.

      Pairing programming isn't always about love.

      - Two different people are most likely have different ways when it comes to approaching programming which could cause tension between two people if not handled properly. I believe how to hand this situation is also a great benefit of the pair programming.

      Feedback:

      We are all required to give feedbacks and rate other feedbacks.

      Feedbacks are very useful because it gives one a chance to read about themselves in a different view. I learned that when I am feeling a bit conflicted, I get quiet instead of expressing myself. It will do no good to me especially if my partner can't read what I am thinking.
      After reading that, I've become more conscious about me which acutally impvoved the whole pair programming.
      When giving a feedback, one should be very careful not to criticize for what happened or didn't happen, but try to focus on what could be improved by giving constructive criticism.
      My background is classical music. It's one field that criticism has been rooted into our mind since we were very young. Some never get over the fear of judging by others, but it might not be their fault - perhaps it's the ones who failed to give them constructive criticism.
