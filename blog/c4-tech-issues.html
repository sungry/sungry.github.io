  <h1>Thoughts On Michel Liès' Don't Mistake Data for Reality</h1>
      <p>
    I felt especially drawn to Liès' article on Don't Mistake Data for Reality.
    Data is hot, and every tech company needs data to function, and most people start to realize how much effects we have from data these days. Facebook, amazon, or what other websites people use contain data which generate money and information about their readers, subscribers, users or whatnot.
    Data is great, and it's proven itself to have great potential to open up a new domain in thie world.
    Liès points out that there are risks in how people perceive data.
    He warns about the fall which happened in 2008 because "too many people believed that data-riceh models are the reality-and acted acocordingly, to their own peril".
    Need I say more about the risk we are carrying by overestimating data as our reality?
    He suggests a good solution: we can access or process data as much as we can or want, but ishould be aware that the sum of the data points will never amount to reality. And we should keep this in mind and act with humility.
    Data is created by us and although what it presents to us is very useful and critical to us, it should not or will not replace the human understanding and our natural talent.
