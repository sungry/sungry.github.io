  <h1> Questions </h1>
      <p>
  Are you a person with lots with questions? If so, what kind of questions do you usually ask? Also, what do you think of the quality of your questions? Appropriate? Good? Constructive? Clear?
  We are all curious people and would like to get answers to things we want to know.
  If we ask good questions, we will more likely to get good answers from people.

  <h2>So What is a good question?</h2>
  A good question is:
    simple, specific and concise. Pretend that you need to ask a questinos to a person who's on the run. A simple yet detailed questions will be very useful because it's important that the person understands exactly what you're asking for and being able to gather the information in their head.

  <h2>How to write a good questions</h2>
  In case of posting a questions, especially a code related one, it's important that others know exactly what you're asking for.
  You might ask conceptual questions or coding questinos.
  When asking a coding questions, try to copy and post the part of code that you're unsure of (but try to avoid posting the entire code). Be sure to describe the problem thoroughly, and try to skim down the question.

  <h2>Proof Reading</h2>

  Once you've written the question, make sure you proofread your questinos and try to read it as a third person view.
