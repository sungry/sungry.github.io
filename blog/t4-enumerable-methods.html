        <h2>Enumerable#map</h2>
          The map method is mighty useful!
          If you're familiar with the collect method, map and collect are interexchaneable. (Sweet, huh?)
          Map method takes a block, and it returns an array. More specifically, the method returns a new array with the result of running block once every element in enum (according to the mighty Ruby Doc).
          For example, I'd like to take the advantage of one of the challenges I had to do this week for Dev Bootcamp.
          In this challenge, map worked beautifully with what I had to do.

          Here is an method I wrote:
            def separate_comma(int)
              int.to_s.split("").reverse.each_slice(3).map { |threesome| threesome.join }.join(",").reverse
            end

          Basically what this method does is that the method takes an integer as its input and returns a comma-separated integer as a string. Let's say we have an integer 10000000 passed in and we want to see "10,000,000" returned!

          First, int.to_s turns the integer into a string. ("100000000")
          Second, #split("") method turns the string into an array which contains this (["1","0","0","0","0","0","0","0"])
          Third, now we reverse that array. (["0","0","0","0","0","0","0","1"]) Why? because it's easier to iterate through an array from left to right then right to left!
          Fourth, each_slice(3) will put the elements of an array in a group of 3 [["0","0","0"], ["0","0","0"], ["0","1"]]
          <emp>Fifth and NOW</emp>, the map method goes through each element of the array and join them into one string [["000"], ["000"], "01"]]
          Sixth, now with that beautiful array we have, we simply turn the array into a string joined by a comma between each element.
          "000,000,01"
          Last, we reverse that and return it :)
          "10,000,000"

          So that was a little bit tedious, but hopefully an effective way to explain what the method does.
          The main difference between map and each method is that map method returns an array but each actually just iterates through a collection but just returns the enumerable. That's what makes the map method very handy. Since it returns a new array with the new result, I didn't have to make another variable to be returned.
