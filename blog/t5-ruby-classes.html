          <h1>CLASS?</h1>
          Oh, we all want to have class. Who doesn't like to be classy?
          Wait, that's not the class we're talking about here.

          Ruby has class just like other programing languages. It does things that we can relate to real objects like furniture, cars.. anything that has relationship with other object(s).

          Let's talk about a dog here:
          A dog could do or be many things. What if we put them all together in one big class?

          class Dog
            def initialize(name, breed)
              @name = name
              @breed = breed
            end

            def bark
              puts "#{@name} goes Woof! Woof!"
            end

          end

          Here's how you define a class.

          class Dog : This is how you define a class.
          Now we have a class named dog. You want to capitalize the first letter as a Ruby tradition.

          Maybe we can make our puppy bark

          def bark
            puts "Woof! Woof!"
          end

          end <= this is for the class.

          What are we missing here? Perhaps we could give the dog a name and a breed?

          Then we want to pass those two arguments.

          but instead of do it directy to the class itself, we could 'initialize' an initialize method.
          When

          dog = Dog.new('Sonny', 'Labrador') is called, those two arguments are placed in 'initialize' method, then they by using instance variables (variables that have '@' sign).
          Instance variables work within the scope of the class it's been declared in.

          What if you want the dog to bark?

          dog.bark will simply print out "Sonny goes Woof! Woof!"

          ---
          This was a rather simple example of it, but you can imagine class can do so many things just like real life objects.
